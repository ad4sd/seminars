SUMMARY:AD4SD Seminar -- Prof. Sharon Li (University of Wisconsin-Madison)
DESCRIPTION:Zoom Link: https://umontreal.zoom.us/j/89215211351?pwd=c0V4NGFXczk5NFN3dnpiUzFqcTNYdz09\nMeeting ID: 892 1521 1351\nPasscode: 789626\n\nTitle: Challenges and Opportunities in Out-of-distribution Detection\n\nAbstract: The real world is open and full of unknowns, presenting significant challenges for machine learning (ML) systems that must reliably handle diverse, and sometimes unknown inputs. Out-of-distribution (OOD) uncertainty arises when a machine learning model sees a test-time input that differs from its training data, and thus should not be predicted by the model. As ML is used for more safety-critical domains, the abilities to handle out-of-distribution data are central in building open-world learning systems. In this talk, I will talk about challenges, methods, and opportunities in uncovering the unknowns of deep neural networks for reliable predictions in an open world.
